Instructions for each program.

Program 1:
-Input a string and press Enter to add it to the list. You may continue this process indefinitely.
-When you wish to stop, press ctrl-D or ctrl-Z.
-When finished with collecting input, the program will print all input strings in reverse order.

Program 2:
-Input an integer and press Enter to add it to the list. You may continue this process indefinitely.
-Inputing anything other than an integer will generate an error, but the program will continue asking for input.
-When you wish to stop, press ctrl-D or ctrl-Z.
-When finished with collecting input, the program will print True if any 2 distinct numbers added to the list have an odd product. It will print False otherwise.

Program 3:
-Input an integer and press Enter to add it to the list. You may continue this process indefinitely.
-Inputing anything other than an integer will generate an error, but the program will continue asking for input.
-When you wish to stop, press ctrl-D or ctrl-Z.
-When finished with collecting input, the program will print all possible permutations of the input list of integers.

Program 4:
-Input an integer and press Enter. The program will ask for 2 integers.
-The first integer must be at least 0.
-The second integer must be less than 2 to the 31st power.
-Inputting anything other than an integer or inputting an out-of-range integer will generate an error, and the program will reset.
-When finished with collecting input, the program will convert the 2 integers to binary strings and print their Hamming distance.
-If the binary strings are unequal in length, the shorter string will have 0s added to the left until the 2 strings are equal in length.
